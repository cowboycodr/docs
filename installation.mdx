## Introduction

KianKit is setup like a regular SvelteKit app with some added folders, and modified routing.

### Structure

```bash
src/
├── lib/ # Library files containing reusable components, layouts, schemas, server-side utilities, and helper functions.
│   ├── components/ # Components used across the application.
│   ├── layouts/ # Layouts that define the structure for different pages or sections.
│   ├── schemas/ # Schemas for data validation and structure.
│   ├── server/ # Server-side code and utilities.
│   └── utils.js # General utility functions used across the project.
├── routes/ # Route definitions and corresponding page components for the application.
│   ├── (app)/ # Application-specific routes, likely for the main user experience.
│   ├── (auth)/ # Authentication-related routes, such as login and signup.
│   ├── (marketing)/ # Marketing pages, possibly for landing pages or promotional content.
│   └── sitemap.xml/ # Sitemap directory, likely for generating a sitemap.xml for SEO.
static/ # Static files like images, fonts, or other assets that don’t change frequently.
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have [pNPM](https://pnpm.io) installed on your machine.
- Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard) project.

You should be good to go!

## Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone the repository" icon="github">
    There are two ways to get KianKit onto your machine, it all comes down to your choice.

    1. You can [fork](https://github.com/cowboycodr/kiankit/fork) KianKit and then clone down your own version of it.
    ```bash
    # After forking the repository
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/<username>/kiankit <your-project-name>
    ```

    2. You can clone the repository directly.
    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cowboycodr/kiankit <your-project-name>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Install dependencies" icon="cube">
    The next step is to install all of the required dependencies for KianKit, we use `pnpm` as the package manager.

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the project directory
    cd <your-project-name>

    # Install dependencies
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Setup

You will need to rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the environment variables with your [Supabase project's](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects) variables.

#### Email configuration

To ensure email & password auth works properly it is recommened to set up a proper SMTP server with Supabase. You can learn more about that [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp). I recommend using [Resend](https://resend.com/) for this. 

#### OAuth

You must follow the following guides to get OAuth up and running:

- [Log in with Google](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google?queryGroups=platform&platform=web)
- [Log in with Github](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github)

## Running the project

Now that your project is set up, you can run the project!

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
